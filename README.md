# Python-game-project
My first python game project any additional info in README file


This project will be created with the help of Pygame
Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games
This particular game project will be a simple 2D game with visual graphic.
Making this whole game was a good learning experience for me as it was created with knowledge I gained from pygame tutorials from which I learnd many important things. 
With my own commentary and commit notes it can be treated not as just a game but rather a quasi tutorial and journey into the game develpoment.
I plan to revisit this game in the future once in a while and make small updates (with my commentary).
I'm not exactly sure of how many files will my game consists of, however I plan to create new repositories for any other games projects I will make

Character sprites haven't been made by instead I downloaded free sprites from websites such as pngkey and pngfind.
Background image was created by me it's composed of free graphical assets I combined together.

More updates soon
